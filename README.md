# Joshua Jacobs' Portfolio

#### This is a compilation of the work that I have done that I would like to showcase. Each is a Python program I put a lot of hard work into that is meant to demonstrate my skills as a Programmer. Although I put a lot of effort into the logic and organization of all the projects, I would like to note that I consider the TODO List App and the Image Watermarking App to be my finest work.
