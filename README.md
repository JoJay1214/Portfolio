# Joshua Jacobs' Portfolio

#### This is a compilation of the work that I have done that I would like to showcase. Each is a Python program I put a lot of hard work into that is meant to demonstrate my skills as a Programmer. Although I put a lot of effort into the logic and organization of all the projects, I would like to note that I consider the TODO List App and the Image Watermarking App to be my finest work.

## Project List

##### (*PLEASE NOTE* I am still working on filling this out to better describe each project.)

### Image Watermarking App

#### My Image Watermarking application allows a user to browse for and open an image to be displayed, as both the original and with a text watermark. The features include the ability for the user to type in their own text for the watermark, as well as adjust the font size, font color (black/white), and position of the text used for the watermark. Finally, the user has the ability to save a copy of their watermarked image. The project uses the Python Imaging Library to do all the image manipulation; and the GUI is built up using TKinter. Although I consider the project to be presentable and well written, I will be doing a bit more work on the private interface to better compartmentalize and organize the different GUI components.

### TODO List App

#### My TODO List application is a tool that allows the user to manage a detailed to-do list. Each task requires a title, but optionally can contain a description and deadline. The user can add a new task, as well as select any task in their list and edit or delete a task. The list contents are managed using SQLite and a database, while the GUI is built using TKinter. Although there are a couple very minor bugs I am still working out, I consider this to be my best written and most well structured program.

### Text to Morse Code App

#### This is a desktop application that translates text to morse code and plays it.

### Tic Tac Toe App

#### This is a desktop application of the classic Tic Tac Toe game.
