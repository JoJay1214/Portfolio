# Joshua Jacobs' Portfolio

#### This is a compilation of the work that I have done that I would like to showcase. Each is a Python program I put a lot of hard work into that is meant to demonstrate my skills as a Programmer. Although I put a lot of effort into the logic and organization of all the projects, I would like to note that I consider the TODO List App and the Image Watermarking App to be my finest work.

## Project List

##### (*PLEASE NOTE* I am still working on filling this out to better describe each project.)

### Image Watermarking App

#### My Image Watermarking application allows a user to browse for and open an image to be displayed, as both the original and with a text watermark. The features include the ability for the user to type in their own text for the watermark, as well as adjust the font size, font color (black/white), and position of the text used for the watermark. Finally, the user has the ability to save a copy of their watermarked image. The project uses the Python Imaging Library to do all the image manipulation; and the GUI is built up using TKinter. Although I consider the project to be presentable and well written, I will be doing a bit more work on the private interface to better compartmentalize and organize the different GUI components.

### TODO List App

#### My TODO List application is a tool that allows the user to manage a detailed to-do list. Each task requires a title, but optionally can contain a description and deadline. The user can add a new task, as well as select any task in their list and edit or delete a task. The list contents are managed using SQLite and a database, while the GUI is built using TKinter. Although there are a couple very minor bugs I am still working out, I consider this to be my best written and most well structured program.

### Text to Morse Code App

#### My Text to Morse Code application is a simple little gadget that allows the user to input text and it will output the text translated into Morse Code. As well, it will even let the user play their inputted message and the program will output the Dits and Dahs of the Morse Code. The GUI is built using TKinter, while the sounds are played simply using the WinSound library.

### Tic Tac Toe App

#### My Tic Tac Toe application is a fun little desktop app meant for two players. It's a very simple design with the X or O marker being randomly selected at the beginning of each match. After getting three in a row, the game announces a winner and resets in three seconds--ready for a new match. The GUI is built using TKinter, and other than the game logic, there is nothing more to it.
